# WebSocket Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The WebSocket connection to specific chat rooms was failing with the error:
```
‚ùå Error checking room membership: cannot access local variable 'username' where it is not associated with a value
```

This prevented users from:
- Connecting to room-specific WebSocket endpoints (`/ws/chat/{room_id}`)
- Receiving real-time messages
- Seeing when other users join rooms

## Root Cause
In `/backend/routers/websocket.py`, the `username` variable was being used in debug print statements before it was defined from the user object:

```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
user = await get_user_by_id(user_id)
# ... 
print(f"üîç Checking room membership: User {username} ...")  # ‚ùå username not defined yet
# ...
username = user.get("username", "Unknown")  # ‚úÖ defined later
```

## Fix Applied
Moved the username assignment to occur before its first use:

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
user = await get_user_by_id(user_id)
username = user.get("username", "Unknown")  # ‚úÖ defined early
# ...
print(f"üîç Checking room membership: User {username} ...")  # ‚úÖ now works
```

## Files Changed
1. **`/backend/routers/websocket.py`**
   - Line ~239: Moved `username = user.get("username", "Unknown")` before room membership check
   - Line ~270: Removed duplicate username assignment

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Browser Test (Recommended)
1. Start the backend server: `python3 main.py`
2. Open `/backend/chat_test_fixed.html` in your browser
3. Login both users (AashiJain and AnwesaMondal)
4. Create a direct chat or select existing room
5. Send messages from one user - they should appear in real-time on the other user's screen

### Method 2: Manual Browser Test
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to your frontend application
3. Login as different users in each window
4. Create or join a room
5. Send messages - verify real-time delivery

### Method 3: Python Test Script
```bash
cd /Users/adityajain/SmartFileTransfer/backend
python3 test_websocket_fix.py
```

## Expected Results After Fix
‚úÖ **WebSocket Connections**: Users can successfully connect to room-specific WebSocket endpoints
‚úÖ **Real-time Messaging**: Messages appear instantly for all users in the room
‚úÖ **Room Visibility**: Rooms created by one user appear for other users
‚úÖ **No 403 Errors**: Room membership checks work properly
‚úÖ **User Status**: Online users are tracked correctly in rooms

## System Architecture Summary
- **REST API**: Creates messages and rooms (works correctly)
- **WebSocket**: Delivers real-time updates (now fixed)
- **Database**: Stores all data persistently (works correctly)
- **Room Membership**: Validates access properly (now fixed)

The fix ensures the complete real-time chat system works as intended with proper synchronization between users.
